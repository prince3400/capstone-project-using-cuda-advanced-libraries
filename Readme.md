Image_Manipulation
Using CUDA and Gpu Computation to do batch processing and apply different Image Filters as well as do batch image manipulation to multiple input jpg or png images

#Features CUDA-Accelerated Processing: Custom CUDA kernels for fast parallel image processing

Multiple Filters and Image Manipulators: Gaussian blur, Sharpen, DeNoiser, Deblur, Edge Detection, Black & White Filter, Auto Color Balance.

Batch Processing: Process entire directories of images

Multi-Format Support: Handles both PNG and JPG/JPEG images

Performance Metrics: Displays total processing time and per-image averages

Prerequisites
System Requirements
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
CUDA Toolkit (10.0 or later)
GCC/G++ compiler
Linux (tested on Arch Linux)
Install CUDA
Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S cuda nvidia nvidia-utils
Ubuntu: sudo apt update sudo apt install build-essential nvidia-cuda-toolkit nvidia-driver-535
Windows:
Install CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA website.
Install Visual Studio 2022 (with C++ tools).
Verify with: nvcc --version nvidia-smi
Setup
Adjust GPU Architecture Edit the makefile and set the correct flag for you gpu
Building
Linux (Arch/Ubuntu): make or nvcc -std=c++11 -O3 -arch=sm_86 main.cu -o image_filter Windows (Developer Command Prompt): nvcc -std=c++11 -O3 -arch=sm_86 main.cu -o image_filter.exe

Usage
By default there are some test images, which can be deleted in the input filter. Any images which need filters need to be placed inside the input_images folder
Linux - ./image_filter <input_directory> <output_directory>
Windows - image_filter.exe input_images output_images
